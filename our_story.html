								How it all Happened...
							</h1>

							<p>
								He said: "She wanted me from the moment she saw me!"
							</p>

							<p>
								<img src="images/jen.1.jpg" width="150" height="146" align="right" alt="Jennifer" class="img_border" />
								She said: "Ugh!  A lady never chases a boy.  He wanted me, and did everything he could to get me!"
							</p>

							<p>
								The truth: Maybe a little bit of both... We met on our second day of college at a Filipinos in Liberal Arts and Humanities (FILAH) meeting.  They were holding salsa lessons and we were partners.  After much twirling and hip-rocking, Mark walked me home.
							</p>

							<p>
								Three years later Mark was elected president of Mga Kapatid, the Filipino-student association at UC Davis, and I was elected his secretary.  We worked really closely with each other on several school events.  After a while, I got to know him as more than just a class clown who wore neon orange jumpsuits and zipper earrings in his ear.  He was actually very smart, confident and sincere.
							</p>

							<p>
								<img src="images/mark.1.jpg" width="147" height="210" align="left" alt="Mark" class="img_border" />
								It's nice to know that Mark and I were friends before we were a couple.  However, it does put a downer on the courting portion of our relationship.  He knew he couldn't pull the same tricks he's done with other girls because I already knew of them when he'd done it.  There was no recycling happening with me!  That just meant that I demanded and deserved creativity &ndash; nothing more than any other girl would expect, no?
							</p>

							<p style="clear: both;">
								In the end, it must have been worth it because here we are five years later ï¿½ turning 26 and getting married.
